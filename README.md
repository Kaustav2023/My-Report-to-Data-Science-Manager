# My-Report-to-Data-Science-Manager
As a data scientist when your manager gives you a machine learning problem about a client, you are expected to build a report on the machine learning model best suited for the business problem. You are not supposed to guess which model might work the best for the assignment but compare all the possible machine learning models and their accuracy score (or whatever metric you deem to be fit for the problem).

All the models and metrics I used here are :
* MODELS:
- Dummy Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
* METRICS:
- Accuracy Score
- f1 Score
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix
- AUC ROC Curve
